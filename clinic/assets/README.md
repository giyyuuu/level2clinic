This directory should contain the following image assets for the Expo app:

## Required Assets

1. **icon.png** (1024x1024px)
   - App icon displayed on the home screen
   - Should be square with no transparency

2. **splash.png** (1242x2436px recommended)
   - Splash screen shown when app is loading
   - Should match your app's branding

3. **adaptive-icon.png** (1024x1024px)

## Creating Placeholder Assets

If you don't have custom assets yet, you can:

1. Use Expo's default assets (they will be generated automatically)
2. Create simple placeholder images with your branding
3. Use online tools to generate app icons

## Notes

- All images should be PNG format
- Icons should follow platform guidelines (Android Material Design)
- For production, replace these with professional assets
